##README for Treasure Hunt Game
###Description
In this treasure hunt game, you are tasked with finding Santa's lost gift! Be careful though, some of the presents have actually been switched with eggnog, and if you find that instead, you lose!

###Installation
This game is not deployed, so if you would like to play it, you can clone this repo and simply open the index.html file locally in your browser window (ideally Google Chrome). I do so by dragging and dropping the index.html from my code editor to Google.

###Technologies Used
This application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was built during LEARN Academy's weekend jumpstart program prior to my enrollment in the bootcamp.

###Credits
This game was made by myself and fellow developer [Bora Ros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bora-ros/). Please do check him out--without his help, this wouldn't have been possible!

###Future Improvements
If I ever were to come back to this application, I think I would do several edits for accessibility. Currently, the font choices are not dyslexic friendly, and the contrasting colors can be a bit harsh on the eyes. I would love to edit these things for better readability. Also, I think that reworking the logic to allow for several difficulty levels with more boxes or less turns would be fun!
